i once wandered the stars
shining up above the sky
wondering whether to fall
but when i looked toward earth and mars
i wanted only to climb higher
i just wanted to fly
no matter the drop
no matter how hard i fall
ill climb until i can climb no further
and ill reach for the stars until i can reach no further
